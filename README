This file contains information about how to set up the
software. For licensing information, see 'LICENSE'.


2) Supported Platforms
This is developed to run on a server with apache2 on Linux and clients using
Mozilla Firefox. Other webservers and browsers might work as well. If you find
bugs with other configurations, you are welcome to write patches and submit them
back to the project.


3) How to set up a new installation:

3.1) Prequisites
- You need a web server that is accessible by your whiteboard machines. Having
  the server in the LAN improves speed, however it is difficult to access the
  slides from other locations in that case, you'd need port forwarding etc.
- The web server needs to support php, and php must have write access to some
  part of the file system so we can store the slides there.

3.2) Installing
- Copy maler.html, storage.php and the icon images (.png files) to a directory
  of your web server.
- Download the jQuery javascript toolkit from
  http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.1.min.js
  and put that file where you put the scboard files.
- Create a subdirectory called 'stored' there.
- Go to this new directory and create subdirectories for all classes that shall
  use the software. Make sure that the php script (read: the webserver) has
  full read/write access to these directories.
- Make sure the following software is installed on the server. If it is not,
  install it.
   - ocrad (http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/) 
   - Imagemagick (http://imagemagick.org/). 
   - bash (http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)
- You should now be able to access the program through a webbrowser from your
  whiteboard machines.
